Modular Survey System with Data Analytics, SJCE

In this era of ever-increasing data collection and voluminous data interpretation, it is
inevitable to generate self-sufficient and modern systems. Satisfying the need for data analysis is
essential in todayâ€™s world. We aim to achieve this by adopting a modular approach. Our proposed
device is designed to adapt and carry out any variation of census, voting or simple data acquisition,
with the help of user friendly code snippets that integrate the modular snap-on. Our project
addresses this issue of massive data analysis by developing a custom survey system for modes
of voting and polling. The system developed is made very convenient to operate and to generate
the analysis. Our project involves the use of latest technologies in use as of now. The system is
adaptable and customizable. The problems faced in this industry is addressed in our project by developing
a system which can be a replacement of the current EVMs in the long term. This system
offers adaptability to any voting/data acquisition process, high level of security, basic and efficient
user interface, data analysis and prediction and portability. We intend to integrate all these features
and develop a unique and modular system.
